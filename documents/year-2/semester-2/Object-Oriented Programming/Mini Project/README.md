## **Project Description**
The **Course Registration System** is a Java-based, menu-driven program that allows users to log in as either an admin or a student. The system starts with a main menu where users can choose to log in as Admin, log in as Student, or Exit the program. Admins can add and remove students, add courses, and view all students (displayed as Name (ID)). Students can register for courses, remove registered courses, and view their registered courses. The system uses core Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, exception handling, and dynamic data storage with `ArrayList`.

### ✅ Chapter 5: Vectors and ArrayList
- `ArrayList<Student>` is used to store all students in the system.
- `ArrayList<Course>` stores all available courses.
- Each `Student` object has its own `ArrayList<Course>` for registered courses.
- The program demonstrates usage of `.add()`, `.remove()`, `.get()`, and enhanced `for` loops for dynamic data management.

```java
ArrayList<Student> students = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<Course> courses = new ArrayList<>();
students.add(new Student("John Doe", "S123", "pass123"));
courses.add(new Course("Mathematics"));
student.registerCourse(courses.get(0));
students.remove(0);
```

### ✅ Chapter 6: Class Relationships
- **Inheritance**: The abstract class `User` is extended by both `Student` and `Admin`, demonstrating classic inheritance.
- **Association**: Each `Student` has an `ArrayList<Course>` for their registered courses, showing a "has-a" relationship between `Student` and `Course`.


```java
abstract class User {
    protected String username;
    protected String password;
    // ...
}

class Student extends User {
    private String studentId;
    private ArrayList<Course> registeredCourses;
    // ...
}

class Admin extends User {
    // ...
    public void showMenu(Scanner scanner, ArrayList<Student> students, ArrayList<Course> courses) {
        // Interacts with students and courses
    }
}
```

### ✅ Chapter 7: Inheritance
- The abstract class `User` defines shared attributes (`username`, `password`) and methods (`login`, `showMenu`).
- `Admin` and `Student` both inherit from `User` and implement/override the `showMenu` method.
- This structure supports code reuse and logical hierarchy in the program.

```java
abstract class User {
    protected String username;
    protected String password;
    public abstract void showMenu(Scanner scanner, ArrayList<Student> students, ArrayList<Course> courses);
}

class Admin extends User {
    // ...
    @Override
    public void showMenu(Scanner scanner, ArrayList<Student> students, ArrayList<Course> courses) {
        // Admin menu implementation
    }
}

class Student extends User {
    // ...
    @Override
    public void showMenu(Scanner scanner, ArrayList<Student> students, ArrayList<Course> courses) {
        // Student menu implementation
    }
}
```

### ✅ Chapter 8: Polymorphism
- The `showMenu` method is overridden in both `Admin` and `Student` subclasses.
- When `showMenu` is called on a `User` reference, Java determines at runtime which version to execute based on the actual object type (admin or student).
- This is an example of **method overriding** — a form of polymorphism.

```java
User user1 = new Admin("admin", "admin123");
User user2 = new Student("John Doe", "S123", "pass123");

user1.showMenu(scanner, students, courses); // Shows admin menu
user2.showMenu(scanner, students, courses); // Shows student menu
```

### ✅ Chapter 9: Exception Handling
- The program uses `try-catch` blocks to handle:
  - Invalid numeric input (e.g., entering letters when expecting numbers in menus)
  - Invalid index selection from course or student lists
- This ensures the program runs smoothly without crashing on user mistakes.

```java
try {
    int mainChoice = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
    // ...
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
    System.out.println("Invalid input. Please enter a number.");
    continue;
}

// Example for removing a student
System.out.print("Enter student number to remove: ");
int removeIndex = scanner.nextInt() - 1;
scanner.nextLine();
if (removeIndex >= 0 && removeIndex < students.size()) {
    students.remove(removeIndex);
    System.out.println("Student removed.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid student number.");
}
```

## **How to Use**
1. Compile the program:
   ```
   javac CourseRegistrationSystem.java
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```
   java CourseRegistrationSystem
   ```

3. Use the main menu to navigate:
   ```
   === Course Registration System ===
   1. Login as Admin
   2. Login as Student
   3. Exit
   ```

4. **Admin Login:**
   - Enter Admin ID: `admin`
   - Enter password: `admin123`
   - Admin can add students, add courses, view all students (displayed as Name (ID)), and remove students.
   
   **Admin Menu:**
   ```
   --- Admin Menu ---
   1. Add Student
   2. Add Course
   3. View All Students
   4. Remove Student
   5. Logout
   ```

5. **Student Login:**
   - Enter the Student ID and password as set by the admin.
   - Students can register for courses, remove registered courses, and view their registered courses.
   
   **Student Menu:**
   ```
   --- Student Menu ---
   1. Register Course
   2. Remove Registered Course
   3. View Registered Courses
   4. Logout
   ```

6. **Exit:**
   - Select option 3 to exit the program.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates complete application of Java OOP concepts across Chapters 5–9, fulfilling all rubric requirements including dynamic data structures, class relationships, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling in a single cohesive console application.
